# STAT 350 Final Project

## Abstract 
```{r}
Our main purpose is to conduct a thorough regression analysis to analyze if there exist a linear relationship between U.S. death rate and a variety of independent variables. A special observation (crazytown) is also added to see if it will have any impact on feature selection and if we can detect it during model validation. At the end of all our analysis, we conclude that:
- Crazytown is identifiable during model validity analysis
- crazytown does impact feature selection, but only for manual stepwise regression
- our final linear regression model satisfies all assumption requirements
- within our variables, the most explanatory for U.S. death rate are unemployment rate, poverty level, per capital income, and number of social security beneficiaries per 1000 residents
